    <h3>Scientific Evenings</h3>
    <p>Observational sessions and stargazing nights that introduce the sky and telescopes to the public while emphasizing safe, responsible observing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the team is still registering in the country and approvals take time, astronomical evenings will be scheduled later.</li>
      <li>Announcements will be made in advance via our channels.</li>
    </ul>
