Then the team moved to expand internationally and joined the ISAC asteroid observation activity run by NASA and Harvard University and other astronomical organizations. The team organized successful camps then represented Iraq in international scientific competitions, namely the IAAC competition. In the final three members: two members placed within the top 15% of qualifiers and one member placed within the top 20% of qualifiers, and one member received an honorable mention.
